# Counterexamples: weak immersions that are not immersions

The inclusion `ι : ℓ¹ → ℓ²` is a continuous injective linear map, hence a weak immersion
between the Banach spaces `ℓ¹` and `ℓ²` (seen as manifolds), but it is not an immersion: its
differential `ι` is not a topological isomorphism onto its range, since the vectors
`x_n = e₀ + ⋯ + e_{n-1}` have `‖x_n‖₁ = n` and `‖x_n‖₂ = √n`.
(`isWeakImmersion_lpInclusion`, `not_isImmersion_lpInclusion`).

Continuity of `ι` is obtained from the closed graph theorem: its graph is closed because the
coordinate evaluations are continuous on both spaces.
