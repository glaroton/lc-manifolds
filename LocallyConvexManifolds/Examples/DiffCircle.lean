## From the circle to its lifts (covering theory; not formalized here)

Let `π : ℝ → S¹ = ℝ / ℤ` be the projection, a covering map and a local diffeomorphism. The
following facts are classical and are **not** formalized in this file; we work directly with
the lifts.

* *Existence and uniqueness of lifts.* Since `ℝ` is simply connected, every continuous
  `f : S¹ → S¹` has a continuous lift `φ : ℝ → ℝ`, `π ∘ φ = f ∘ π`, by the lifting criterion
  (Hatcher, Prop. 1.33), and two lifts differ by an integer constant: integer translations are
  deck transformations, and a lift is determined by its value at one point (Hatcher,
  Prop. 1.34).
* *Degree.* `φ (x + 1) - φ x` is a continuous integer valued function, hence a constant `d`, the
  degree of `f` (Katok–Hasselblatt, Lemma 2.4.3 and Definition 2.4.4). A homeomorphism has
  degree `±1`, since the degree is multiplicative (Proposition 8.2.2), and it preserves the
  orientation exactly when `d = 1` (§11.1, p. 388), i.e. `φ (x + 1) = φ x + 1`; then
  `φ = id + u` with `u` `1`-periodic.
* *Smoothness.* Since `π` is a local diffeomorphism, `φ` is smooth if and only if `f` is, and
  `φ` is a diffeomorphism of `ℝ` exactly when `f` is a diffeomorphism of `S¹` (the inverse of
  `f` lifts to the inverse of `φ`).

So `Diff⁺(S¹) ≅ Ω / ℤ`, where `n ∈ ℤ` acts by `u ↦ u + n` (Herman, Ch. I, 1.7, where
`D^r(T¹) = {id + φ}` is called the universal cover of `Diff^r_+(T¹)`; Hamilton, Example 4.2.6,
who parametrizes `Diff⁺(S¹)` by `S¹ × {f' > 0, ∫ f' = 2π}`). The set `Ω` below is convex
(`DiffCircle.convex_domain`), hence contractible, and `Ω → Diff⁺(S¹)` is the universal cover
`\widetilde{Diff}⁺(S¹)` (Herman, Introduction).

## The lifts

An orientation preserving diffeomorphism of the circle lifts to a diffeomorphism
`φ = id + u` of `ℝ` with `u` smooth and `1`-periodic and `φ' = 1 + u' > 0`. We identify
the universal cover of `Diff⁺(S¹)` with the set

  `Ω = {u ∈ C^∞_per | 1 + u'(x) > 0 for all x}`.

Main results:

* `DiffCircle.isOpen_domain`, `DiffCircle.convex_domain`: `Ω` is open and convex in the
  Fréchet space `C^∞_per`. Hence `Ω` is a manifold modeled on `C^∞_per` (`DiffCircle.Ω`, an
  `Opens`, with its induced charted space and `MBManifold` structure). It is a **Fréchet
  manifold**: the model is complete
  (`CInfPer.instCompleteSpace`), but not normable, so it is not a Banach manifold.
* For `u ∈ Ω`, the lift `φ = id + u` is an increasing homeomorphism of `ℝ`, smooth with smooth
  inverse, commuting with the translation by `1` (`DiffCircle.liftHomeomorph`,
  `DiffCircle.contDiff_liftHomeomorph_symm`).
* `Ω` is closed under the group operations: the inverse `φ⁻¹ = id + v` has `v ∈ Ω`
  (`DiffCircle.inv_mem`) and the composition `(id + u) ∘ (id + w) = id + (w + u ∘ (id + w))`
  lies in `Ω` (`DiffCircle.comp_mem`), with `1 + (w + u ∘ φ_w)' = (1 + u' ∘ φ_w)(1 + w')`.
* Conversely, every diffeomorphism `φ` of `ℝ` with `φ (x + 1) = φ x + 1` is `id + u` for a unique
  `u ∈ Ω` (`DiffCircle.existsUnique_mem_domain_lift_eq`). More precisely, `u ∈ Ω` if and only if
  `id + u` has a differentiable left inverse (`DiffCircle.mem_domain_iff`); monotonicity is
  automatic. So `Ω` is exactly the group of diffeomorphisms of `ℝ` commuting with the
  translation by `1`.

The smoothness of composition and inversion as maps `Ω × Ω → Ω`, `Ω → Ω` (which makes `Ω` a Lie
group) is not proved here; it belongs to the theory of Lie groups.
