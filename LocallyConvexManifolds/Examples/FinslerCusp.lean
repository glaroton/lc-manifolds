# A Finsler length structure on `ℝ²` that is not a Finsler metric

This example shows that the two continuity conditions of `LocallyConvexManifolds.Metric.Finsler`
are really different, already on `ℝ²` (with the sup norm). Let
`β (x, y) = max (0, x² - |y|) / (x² + |y|)` (and `β 0 = 0`), and
`μ_p (v) = ‖v‖ + β(p) |v₂|`.

* Each `μ_p` is a reversible Finsler norm (`CuspFinsler.isNondegenerate`,
  `CuspFinsler.isReversible`).
* `β` equals `1` on the `x`-axis minus the origin and `0` at the origin, so `μ` is **not
  continuous on the tangent bundle** at `(0, e₂)`: it is not a Finsler metric
  (`CuspFinsler.not_continuous`).
* `μ` **is continuous along every `C¹` curve** `γ`: it is a Finsler length structure
  (`CuspFinsler.lengthStructure`). Away from the origin `β` is continuous. If `γ(t₀) = 0` and
  `γ̇₂(t₀) ≠ 0`, then near `t₀` the curve leaves the cusp `{|y| < x²}` where `β ≠ 0`, because
  `|γ₂ t| ≥ c |t - t₀|` while `γ₁(t)² = O(|t - t₀|²)`. If `γ̇₂(t₀) = 0`, then
  `0 ≤ β(γ) |γ̇₂| ≤ |γ̇₂| → 0`.

So the phenomenon is not infinite dimensional: a `C¹` curve through `p` only sees the pairs
`(p, v)` that are compatible with the way it approaches `p`, and the pairs `((1/n, 0), e₂)`,
which converge in `TM` to `(0, e₂)`, are not of this kind. The natural examples in infinite
dimensions are the quotient metrics of homogeneous spaces (Larotonda, Forum Math. 31 (2019),
Lemma 3.19).
