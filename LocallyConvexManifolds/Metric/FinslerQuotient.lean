# Lifting curves versus lifting neighborhoods

References: G. Larotonda, *The metric geometry of infinite dimensional Lie groups and their
homogeneous spaces*, Forum Math. 31 (2019), §3, Lemma 3.19.

This file explains where the two continuity conditions of `LocallyConvexManifolds.Metric.Finsler`
come from. Let `π : N → M` be a `C¹` map (written `pr` in the code, since `π` denotes the real
number) and `μ` a field of Finsler seminorms on `M`. Typically `μ` is defined through `π`, as a
quotient metric `μ(w) = inf {μ_N(v) : Tπ v = w}`, and what one controls is the function `μ ∘ Tπ` on
`TN`.

* **Lifting curves gives a Finsler length structure**
  (`FinslerSeminormField.toFinslerLengthStructureOfLifts`). If every `C¹` curve in `M` has, near
  each time, a `C¹` lift `Γ` to `N` (`π ∘ Γ = γ`), and `μ ∘ Tπ` is continuous along the velocities
  of `C¹` curves of `N`, then `μ` is a Finsler length structure. The point is the chain rule
  `γ̇ = Tπ(Γ̇)` (`tangentMap_velocity`).
* **Lifting neighborhoods gives a Finsler metric**
  (`FinslerSeminormField.toFinslerMetricOfIsQuotientMap`). If `Tπ : TN → TM` is a quotient map
  and `μ ∘ Tπ` is continuous on `TN`, then `μ` is continuous on `TM`: it is a Finsler metric.

**Submersions.** For Banach manifolds, a submersion (surjective differential with complemented
kernel) has local smooth sections through every point, by the inverse function theorem. Then
`Tπ` is open, hence a quotient map, and `C¹` curves lift locally (compose them with a local
section), so the hypotheses on `π` of both statements hold. On locally convex manifolds there is
no inverse function theorem and neither property is automatic: a curve may have `C¹` lifts while
`Tπ` is not a quotient map. This is the situation of homogeneous spaces `G/K` of infinite
dimensional Lie groups in Larotonda, Lemma 3.19: under a uniformity assumption on the metric of
`G`, the quotient metric is continuous along paths that have piecewise smooth lifts, and
continuous on the tangent bundle when `π_*` is a quotient map.

The difference between the two notions is not specific to infinite dimensions: on `ℝ²` there is a
Finsler length structure that is not a Finsler metric
(`LocallyConvexManifolds.Examples.FinslerCusp`).
