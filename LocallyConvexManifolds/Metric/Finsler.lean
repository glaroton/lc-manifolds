# Finsler metrics and Finsler length structures

This file defines Finsler seminorms, Finsler metrics and Finsler length structures on manifolds
modeled on locally convex spaces, and the length of curves and the distance they induce,
following [Lar19, Def. 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 2.7 and Lemma 3.19]; see also [Pal66, §2, Def. 2.1 and 2.6]
and [BBI01, §2.1.1] (definition of length structures).

## Main definitions

* `FinslerSeminorm`: a continuous, subadditive, positively homogeneous function `E → ℝ≥0`
  ([Lar19, Def. 2.2]).
* `FinslerSeminormField`: a Finsler seminorm on each tangent space.
* `FinslerMetric`: a field of Finsler seminorms continuous on the tangent bundle
  ([Lar19, Def. 2.3(2)]).
* `FinslerLengthStructure`: a field of Finsler seminorms continuous along `C¹` curves
  ([Lar19, Def. 2.3(1)]).
* `FinslerLengthStructure.length`: the length of a `C¹` curve on an interval ([Lar19, Def. 2.6]).
* `FinslerLengthStructure.Reach`: chains of `C¹` arcs, encoding piecewise `C¹` paths.
* `FinslerLengthStructure.dist`: the Finsler distance, infimum of lengths of piecewise `C¹` paths
  ([Lar19, Def. 2.7]).

## Main results

* `FinslerMetric.toFinslerLengthStructure`: every Finsler metric is a Finsler length structure.
* `FinslerLengthStructure.dist_triangle`: the triangle inequality for the Finsler distance.
* `FinslerLengthStructure.dist_comm`: the distance of a reversible structure is symmetric.
* `FinslerLengthStructure.dist_comm_le`: with a reversibility constant `λ`,
  `d_b(y, x) ≤ λ d_b(x, y)`.

## Terminology: two continuity conditions, two names

Let `M` be a manifold modeled on a locally convex space `E`, in the Michal–Bastiani setting, so
that the tangent bundle `TM` is a topological space. The objects of this file are, from the
most general to the most specific:

* A **Finsler seminorm** on `E` (`FinslerSeminorm`, [Lar19, Def. 2.2]): a continuous function
  `E → ℝ≥0` that is subadditive and *positively* homogeneous, `μ (c • v) = c * μ v` for
  `c ≥ 0`. It need not be symmetric (`μ (-v) ≠ μ v` is allowed) nor definite.
* A **field of Finsler seminorms** (`FinslerSeminormField`): a Finsler seminorm `μ_p` on each
  tangent space `T_p M`. **Nothing is assumed about how `μ_p` depends on `p`.**
* A **Finsler metric** (`FinslerMetric`, [Lar19, Def. 2.3(2)]): a field of Finsler seminorms
  such that `μ : TM → ℝ` is **continuous on the tangent bundle**. This is the notion meant by
  "Finsler metric" without further qualification, here and in the literature.
* A **Finsler length structure** (`FinslerLengthStructure`, [Lar19, Def. 2.3(1)], there called
  "continuous along paths"): a field of Finsler seminorms such that `t ↦ μ (γ̇ t)` is
  **continuous along every `C¹` curve `γ`**, and nothing more. It is exactly what is needed to
  measure lengths of curves, hence the name (compare the length structures of
  [BBI01, §2.1.1]).

Every Finsler metric is a Finsler length structure (`FinslerMetric.toFinslerLengthStructure`):
the velocity of a `C¹` curve is a continuous curve in `TM` (`continuous_velocity`). The converse
fails, and the weaker notion is not a technical convenience: the quotient metric on a
homogeneous space `G/K` is always a Finsler length structure, but it is a Finsler metric only
when `π_* : TG → T(G/K)` is a quotient map ([Lar19, Lemma 3.19]). In infinite dimensions,
paths lift along `π` but neighborhoods need not.

**Rule of use.** Lengths and distances are defined for Finsler length structures
(`FinslerLengthStructure.length`, `FinslerLengthStructure.dist`), so that they apply to quotient
metrics; statements that compare the topologies of `M` and of the distance use Finsler metrics.
Every statement in this file says which of the two it assumes.

**Two words we avoid.** We do not say *weak* Finsler metric: "weak" refers to the topology of
the fibers (a weak Riemannian metric does not induce the topology of the model), not to the
continuity in `TM`. We do not say *Finsler structure* alone: Palais uses it for the much stronger
notion in which every `μ_p` is a norm inducing the topology of the fiber, locally uniformly
equivalent to `μ_{p₀}` ([Pal66, Def. 2.1 and 2.6]). That notion only makes sense for normable
models; it is not formalized here.

**Variants** ([Lar19, Def. 2.2]): `FinslerSeminormField.IsNondegenerate` (each `μ_p` is a
Finsler *norm*: `μ_p v = 0 → v = 0`) and `FinslerSeminormField.IsReversible` (`μ_p (-v) = μ_p v`).

## Curves

Curves are `C¹` maps `ℝ → M` (`IsCkCurve E 1`), restricted to an interval `[a, b]` when their
length is measured. As in [Lar19], the distance is taken over **piecewise `C¹` paths**, encoded
as chains of `C¹` arcs (`FinslerLengthStructure.Reach`): an arc `γ|[a, b]` followed by a chain
from `γ b`. Concatenation of chains is then immediate (`Reach.trans`), and so is the **triangle
inequality** (`FinslerLengthStructure.dist_triangle`); no smoothing at the junctions is needed.
Reversing a curve (`isCkCurve_reverse`, `velocity_reverse`) preserves lengths when `μ` is
reversible, and then the distance is symmetric (`FinslerLengthStructure.dist_comm`). With a
reversibility constant, `μ_x(-v) ≤ λ μ_x(v)`, the asymmetry of the distance is bounded,
`d_b(y, x) ≤ λ d_b(x, y)` (`FinslerLengthStructure.dist_comm_le`).
