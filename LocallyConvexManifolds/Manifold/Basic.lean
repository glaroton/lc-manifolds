# Manifolds modeled on locally convex spaces

Mathlib's `ChartedSpace` and `StructureGroupoid` accept an arbitrary topological model space, so
a manifold modeled on `E` is a `ChartedSpace E M` with `HasGroupoid M (mbGroupoid E)`, where
`mbGroupoid E` consists of the Michal–Bastiani smooth diffeomorphisms between open subsets of `E`
([Nee06, §I.3]; [GN26, Ch. 3]).

## Main definitions

* `mbGroupoid E`: the groupoid of Michal–Bastiani smooth diffeomorphisms between open subsets
  of `E`.
* `MBManifold E M`: a smooth manifold modeled on the locally convex space `E`.
* `BanachManifold`, `HilbertManifold`: manifolds modeled on a Banach space and on a Hilbert
  space (both complete).

## Implementation notes

**Convention: the model space need not be complete.** The model space `E` is a Hausdorff locally
convex space, and *no completeness is assumed*. This is the convention of Glöckner–Neeb
([GN26, §5.7]: "as for manifolds, we do not assume that the model space of a Lie group is
complete", following [Glo02]); Milnor [Mil84] assumed sequentially complete model spaces
instead.

* The formal theory (charts, smooth maps, tangent bundle, vector fields, connections,
  submanifolds) does not use completeness: the calculus of `LocallyConvex.Analysis` replaces
  integrals in the model space by Hahn–Banach arguments.
* Every result that needs completeness says so in its hypotheses, and names the kind it needs
  (complete, sequentially complete, Mackey complete). Typically: integrals with values in the
  model space, ordinary differential equations and exponential maps, regularity of Lie groups,
  inverse function theorems.
* In particular, a manifold modeled on a normed space is **not** a Banach manifold unless the
  normed space is complete, and a manifold modeled on an inner product space is **not** a Hilbert
  manifold unless the space is complete. Statements about Banach or Hilbert manifolds in this
  library always carry the completeness hypothesis (`CompleteSpace`).
* Without completeness things do go wrong: Glöckner and Neeb [GN26, Example 5.6.8] give a Lie
  group modeled on an incomplete normed algebra (rational functions on `[0, 1]` with the sup
  norm) that has no exponential function.

/-- A **Banach manifold**: a smooth manifold modeled on a Banach space `E`, i.e. a normed space
(`NormedAddCommGroup E`, `NormedSpace ℝ E`) which is complete (`CompleteSpace E`). On normed
spaces Michal–Bastiani smoothness agrees with Fréchet smoothness
(`LocallyConvex.Analysis.smoothMBOn_iff_contDiffOn`), so this is the classical notion [Lan99]. A
manifold modeled on an incomplete normed space is an `MBManifold`, but not a Banach manifold. -/
