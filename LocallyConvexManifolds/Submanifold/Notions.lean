# Notions of submanifolds and immersions

In finite dimensions all reasonable notions of submanifold and immersion agree, up to the
topological phenomena discussed below. In infinite dimensions they split apart, already for
Banach models and more so for locally convex ones. This file records them as separate
definitions, with names that say what each notion is. The sources are [GN26, Definitions 3.1.10,
3.3.22, Remark 3.3.23, Lemma 3.3.24], [Nee06, §II.6 and §IV.4], [KMW24] and [Jor82].

## Main definitions

For a smooth map `f : M → N` and its differential `T_x f` (read in charts):

* `IsWeakImmersion`: `T_x f` is injective at every point, with no condition on its range;
* `IsImmersion`: moreover `T_x f` has closed range and is a topological isomorphism onto it;
* `IsSplitImmersion`: moreover `T_x f` has a continuous linear left inverse, i.e. its range is
  complemented.

For an injective `f`, the image carries the structure transported from `M`:

* `IsWeaklyImmersedSubmanifold`, `IsImmersedSubmanifold`: `f` is an injective weak immersion,
  resp. an injective immersion;
* `IsInitialSubmanifold` ([GN26, Def. 3.3.22]): moreover a map `g` from a test manifold is
  smooth as soon as `f ∘ g` is.

For a subset `X ⊆ M` with slice charts onto a closed subspace `S`:

* `IsSplitSubmanifold`: an embedded submanifold (`IsEmbeddedSubmanifold`, in
  `LocallyConvexManifolds.Submanifold.Basic`) whose model `S` is complemented.

## Main results

* split immersion ⇒ immersion ⇒ weak immersion (`IsSplitImmersion.isImmersion`,
  `IsImmersion.isWeakImmersion`);
* the inclusion of an embedded submanifold is an immersion and is initial
  (`IsEmbeddedSubmanifold.isImmersion_val`, `IsEmbeddedSubmanifold.isInitialSubmanifold_val`);
  for a split submanifold it is a split immersion (`IsSplitSubmanifold.isSplitImmersion_val`);
* initial and immersed submanifolds are weakly immersed
  (`IsInitialSubmanifold.isWeaklyImmersedSubmanifold`,
  `IsImmersedSubmanifold.isWeaklyImmersedSubmanifold`).

None of these implications can be reversed, and initial and immersed submanifolds are not
comparable; see the subtleties below.

## Implementation notes

**Subtleties (infinite dimensions).**

* *Weak immersions versus immersions.* The differential can be injective without having closed
  range, already between Banach spaces: the inclusion `ℓ¹ → ℓ²` is continuous, linear,
  injective, and its range is dense and not closed. Formalized in
  `LocallyConvexManifolds.Examples.Counterexamples` (`not_isImmersion_lpInclusion`).
* *Immersions versus split immersions.* A closed subspace need not be complemented, already in
  Banach spaces: by Phillips' lemma `c₀` has no complement in `ℓ^∞`. So `c₀ ⊆ ℓ^∞` is an
  embedded submanifold that is not split, and the inclusion is an immersion that is not a split
  immersion. Formalized, with Whitley's proof, in `LocallyConvexManifolds.Examples.Phillips`
  (`Phillips.not_isSplitImmersion_c0`).
* *Immersions in the sense of Glöckner–Neeb.* Their [GN26, Def. 3.3.25(b)] asks for a local linear
  form with a continuous linear left inverse, which forces the range to be complemented. We do
  not use it as the definition of an immersion: it is much more restrictive than the notion
  above. For Banach models, an immersion with complemented range has this local form by the
  inverse function theorem; for locally convex models that theorem is not available.
* *Initial submanifolds* ([GN26, Def. 3.3.22]). A subset `S ⊆ M` with its own manifold
  structure is initial if the inclusion is smooth with injective differential, and a map
  `P → S` is smooth as soon as it is smooth into `M`. The structure is then unique
  ([GN26, Lemma 3.3.24]), so being initial is a property of the subset; its topology may be finer
  than the induced one ([GN26, Remark 3.3.23]).
  - The universal property alone does not give an injective differential: by Joris' theorem [Jor82]
    (`g²` and `g³` smooth imply `g` smooth) the cusp `t ↦ (t², t³)` has it, and its differential
    vanishes at `0`. This is why the injectivity of the differential is part of the definition
    ([GN26, p. 336]; Karshon–Miyamoto–Watts [KMW24] call the universal property alone a
    *diffeological submanifold*).
  - Initial does not mean embedded: the dense line in the torus is initial. Embedded does not
    follow from injective immersion either: the figure eight `t ↦ (sin t, sin 2t)`,
    `t ∈ (-π, π)`, is an injectively immersed curve that is not initial. The curve
    `s ↦ (sin s, -sin 2s)` is smooth in `ℝ²`, stays in the figure eight, and crosses the origin
    along the other branch; read in the parameter it jumps from `π` to `0` to `-π`
    Formalized, with the parameter `θ = 2 arctan t`, in `LocallyConvexManifolds.Examples.Lemniscate`
    (`not_isInitialSubmanifold_lemniscate`).
* *Mechanisms that destroy initiality.* For an injective weak immersion, smooth maps into the
  ambient manifold that land in the image may fail to lift
  - continuously, because two pieces of the image accumulate on each other (figure eight;
    occurs in finite dimensions);
  - continuously, because there are uncountably many pieces (`ℝ × ℝ_discrete → ℝ²`; excluded
    for second countable domains, this is why Glöckner–Neeb assume separability in
    [GN26, Thm. 9.2.15]);
  - continuously, because the map is not even locally a topological embedding (the linear
    inclusion `ℓ¹ → ℓ²`; infinite dimensions only);
  - continuously, but not smoothly, even when the map is a homeomorphism onto its image
    (infinite dimensions only). Example: `j : ℓ² → ℓ² × ℝ`, `j x = (A x, ‖x‖²)`, with `A`
    diagonal acting on the `n`-th block of `ℓ²(ℕ, ℝ²)` by a scalar `aₙ ≤ e^{-n}`. Its
    differential `v ↦ (A v, 2⟪x, v⟫)` is injective, with non-closed range at `0`, and `j` is a
    homeomorphism onto its image (weak convergence plus convergence of norms). The curve
    `y t = ⊕ₙ n⁻² (cos (n t), sin (n t))` has constant norm and `A ∘ y` is smooth, so `j ∘ y`
    is smooth; but `y` is `C¹` and not `C²` in `ℓ²`. So `j` is topologically embedded, weakly
    immersed and not initial. In finite dimensions a weak immersion whose lifts are continuous
    is initial, so this phenomenon has no finite-dimensional analogue.
* *Unitary orbits.* Let `A = i Σₙ λₙ pₙ` be a skew-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space `H`,
  with distinct real `λₙ` and pairwise orthogonal projections `pₙ` (of any rank) summing to `1`.
  Its stabilizer in `U(H)` is the block-diagonal group `K = ⊕ₙ U(pₙ H)`. `K` is a split Lie
  subgroup, via the conditional expectation `X ↦ Σₙ pₙ X pₙ`. The orbit `U(H)/K → B(H)`,
  `uK ↦ u A u*`, is a weak immersion with differential `X ↦ [X, A]`. It is initial if and only
  if there are finitely many `pₙ`.
  - If there are finitely many `pₙ`, the spectrum is finite and the orbit is a closed embedded
    split submanifold ([BL23]). With two projections of infinite rank it is a Grassmannian.
  - If there are infinitely many `pₙ`, the spectrum is infinite, so `[·, A]` does not have
    closed range (same reference). Then the orbit is not initial. Indeed, for orbits of
    Banach–Lie group actions with split stabilizer, initiality forces closed range: along
    `s ↦ exp(s ξ) · A`, every derivative is bounded by a constant times `‖[ξ, A]‖`. Bump
    curves along directions with `‖[ξ, A]‖` tiny are smooth in `B(H)`, and their lifts to
    `U(H)/K` are continuous but not `C¹`.
* *Initial does not imply immersion.* Let `A` be a compact injective diagonal operator on `ℓ²`
  and `j : ℓ² → ℓ² × (ℓ² ⊗ ℓ²) × (ℓ² ⊗ ℓ² ⊗ ℓ²)`, `j x = (A x, x ⊗ x, x ⊗ x ⊗ x)` (Hilbert tensor
  products). Then `j` is injective, its differential `v ↦ (A v, x ⊗ v + v ⊗ x, …)` is injective,
  and at `0` its range `A(ℓ²) × 0 × 0` is not closed. Nevertheless `j` is initial with respect to
  all test manifolds modeled on Fréchet spaces, it is a homeomorphism onto its image, and the
  image is closed. Let `f : P → ℓ²` be such that `j ∘ f` is smooth.
  - Along a smooth curve `c`, each `⟨f ∘ c, e⟩` has smooth square and cube, which are
    `⟪(f ∘ c) ⊗ (f ∘ c), e ⊗ e⟫` and its cubic analogue. So it is smooth by Joris' theorem.
    A curve in a Banach space all of whose scalar components are smooth is smooth, by uniform
    boundedness and Taylor's formula.
  - Smoothness along curves gives smoothness in the Michal–Bastiani sense when `P` is modeled
    on a Fréchet space. First, the directional derivatives `dᵏ f(p)(v, …, v)` are locally
    bounded. If not, there are `pₘ → p₀` and small `wₘ` with `‖dᵏ f(pₘ)(wₘ, …, wₘ)‖ > m`.
    Take `tₘ = 2⁻ᵐ`, `rₘ = 2⁻ᵐ⁻²` (so the intervals `[tₘ - rₘ, tₘ + rₘ]` are disjoint) and a
    bump `β` supported in `[-1, 1]`, equal to `1` on `[-1/2, 1/2]`. Then
    `c t = p₀ + ∑ₘ β ((t - tₘ) / rₘ) (pₘ - p₀ + (t - tₘ) wₘ)` is smooth if `pₘ - p₀` and `wₘ`
    decay fast enough in every seminorm. Near `tₘ`, `c` is affine, `c t = pₘ + (t - tₘ) wₘ`. So
    `(f ∘ c)⁽ᵏ⁾(tₘ) = dᵏ f(pₘ)(wₘ, …, wₘ)` is unbounded, a contradiction. Local bounds then give
    multilinearity (Boman's theorem on finite-dimensional subspaces) and joint continuity of
    the derivatives (mean value inequality).
  So for this `j` the closed-range condition fails at `0` although `j` is initial. Whether `j`
  is initial with respect to test manifolds modeled on non-metrizable spaces is open: the
  argument above uses sequences.
* *Initial Lie subgroups.* Glöckner–Neeb ([GN26, Def. 9.1.5]) call an initial Lie subgroup
  *strictly initial* when `L(ι)` is injective, a condition that Neeb [Nee06] includes in the
  definition. Not every subgroup carries an initial Lie subgroup structure: `ℓ^∞ ⊆ ℝ^ℕ` does not
  ([GN26, Ex. 9.1.8]).
