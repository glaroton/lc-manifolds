# Immersions with a Banach domain

Let `M` be a Banach manifold, i.e. modeled on a **complete** normed space `E` (`CompleteSpace E`),
and `N` a manifold modeled on a normed space `F`, complete or not. An immersion `f : M → N` (the
differential is a topological isomorphism onto a closed subspace, with no complement assumed)
reflects smoothness of continuous maps: if `g : P → M` is continuous and `f ∘ g` is smooth, then `g`
is smooth (`IsImmersion.smoothMBM_of_comp`). The test manifold `P` may be modeled on any locally
convex space. Consequently, an injective immersion which is a homeomorphism onto its image is an
initial submanifold (`IsImmersedSubmanifold.isInitialSubmanifold`).

The calculus behind this is `LocallyConvex.Analysis.ContDiffMBOn.of_comp_of_boundedBelow`: in charts
the differential is bounded below, and the bound persists near a point because, for Banach spaces,
Michal–Bastiani `C^{k+1}` maps are Fréchet `C^k`.

**Subtleties.**

* No inverse function theorem is used, and no complement of the range of the differential is
  needed. The image of a non-split immersion need not have slice charts: whether such an
  immersion, when a homeomorphism onto its image, is an embedded submanifold is open.
* Completeness of `E` is used: the derivative of a lift is obtained as the limit of Cauchy
  difference quotients. Completeness of `F` is not needed. Recall that a manifold modeled on an
  incomplete normed space is not a Banach manifold.
* For Fréchet or more general locally convex model spaces the statement is open: the lower bound
  of the differential need not persist near a point.
* Continuity of `g` cannot be dropped: the figure eight is an injective immersion that is not
  initial, because a smooth curve in the plane can lift discontinuously.
